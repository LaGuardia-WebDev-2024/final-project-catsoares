    <h1 id ="who">Who is Cat?</h1>
<p>
      Catarina "Cat" Soares was born on August 13, 2008 in the heart of New York City to Brazilian natives from Rio de Janeiro.
  After attending two French private schools up until her Freshman year, she was accepted into the theater program at the prestigious Fiorello H. 
  LaGuardia High School of Music and Performing Arts. She continued to practice her craft alongside a community of the most talented kids in the nation,
  while simultaneously travelling part time with her mother around the world. By Junior year, she had directed two short films in Italy in collaboration with NYFA, 
  was an avid JiuJitsu and Mixed Martial Arts fighter, played multiple instruments along with music mixing, travelled to over 30 countries, started learning Russian daily, and even started working for a PR firm. Closely intertwining her diverse cultural 
  background with stunning cinematography, Cat Soares eventually began her first passion project called "Projet Les Gens". She creative directed, edited, designed, and 
  planned multiple issue's for the project, casting different teenagers in NYC for the shoots and recruiting other creatives. While she is only 16, she already plans to
  continue her studies in Europe once she graduates in 2026 and eventually release a feature film, along with publishing a memoir.
